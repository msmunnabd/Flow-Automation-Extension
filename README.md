## 🔧 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause & Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"Queue Full" Error** | Google Flow limits the number of videos processed simultaneously. **Don't worry**, the Extension will automatically wait and retry every 30s until a slot becomes available. |
| **Video not downloading** | Go to Chrome Settings -\> Downloads -\> **Turn off** *"Ask where to save each file before downloading"*. |
| **"Policy Error"** | Your prompt or image violates Google's content policy. The tool will automatically skip this task and proceed to the next one. |
| **Screen Zoomed Out** | This is an automatic feature of the tool to cover the interface and locate buttons accurately. Please do not adjust the zoom manually while the tool is running. |

## 🔒 Privacy & Data

  * **Local Operation:** Auto Flow runs entirely on your browser.
  * **No Data Collection:** We do not collect your prompts, images, or videos. All data is stored only in your own `Chrome Local Storage` to remember settings.
  * **Permissions:** The extension only requests access to `labs.google/*` pages to perform automation tasks.
